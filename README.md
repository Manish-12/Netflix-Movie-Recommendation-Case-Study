Constraints:

# Introduction
In 2006 Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. They offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of their existing system called Cinematch by 10%. They conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations which they provide to their customers, which is a key part of their business. However, they had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating.
